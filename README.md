Web Design Assignment - Second Semester

The aim of this project is to acquire the skills required to build web sites using front­end technologies, 
and to deepen the student understanding of design methodologies.
A measured approach should be adopted; first analysing the web site requirements,
then sketching and prototyping, before finally building the web site using the required mark­up and CSS sheets.
